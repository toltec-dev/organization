# Security Policy

## Maintainers Team

Members of [the Toltec repository maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/toltec-dev/people) are responsible for pushing updates to the Toltec repository and for managing security reports.
At this time, the team comprises exclusively volunteers who contribute their free time to the project.

## Release Scheme

The Toltec repository features two branches, `stable` and `testing`.
The repo has a short-timed release scheme with new updates pushed to the
`stable` branch every week. It is the responsibility of users to keep their
devices updated to the latest release at all times.

## Guarantees

No support or security guarantee of any kind is provided for the `testing` branch.
Even for the `stable` branch, the Toltec maintainers do not promise that all packages are secure.
They commit to handling security reports on a best-effort basis, for example, by backporting security patches, holding back known-to-be insecure versions, or removing packages from the repository.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an email to <security@toltec-dev.org> for reporting a vulnerability in one of the packages in Toltec.
The maintainers team will reach back to you as soon as possible with more details on how they handled your report.
